# Flatlander Crafted Gems

This is the working demo from "Shaping up with Angular.js" course from
www.codeschool.com. I worked on the code in step with the class so that I
could look at the code later down the line and remind myself what all we did.
Hope this helps anyone else working on the course.

If you look at the commit history, I tried to remember to add section numbers
as I committed. So, in theory, you should be able to revert to certain commits
to not jump ahead of each section of the class.
